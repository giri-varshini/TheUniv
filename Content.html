  <p><h3>Few Important points to understand :</h3></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Does gravitational waves exist like electromagnetic waves? If they do so can we unite gravitational and electromagnetic forces as done in the case of electromagnetic and weak nuclear even they differ in few properties. Actually, all the scientists are trying to unite forces as nature loves symmetry it is obvious that all these forces are actually one unified ones then.</li>
     <br> <li>Electric lines of force don't form closed loops so they are conservative in nature it's given as if they form closed loops work done in a cyclic path should be non zero as some work is to be done they so they don't form and are conservative then what about magnetic lines of force they form closed loops then are they non conservative in nature if so in electromagnetic waves conservative force is travelling perpendicular to a non conservative force but electromagnetic wave is conservative only !?</li>
     <br> <li>Energy can never be created nor be destroyed.Entropy can be created but never destroyed.Mass can be created and can be destroyed (not broadly speaking.. not considering mass as form of energy).Is there anything which cant be created but be destroyed..seems silly cause without creation how can something be destroyed (generally we all think)but, physics(science /reality)is something which is beyond our scope and there's something which can't be created but can be destroyed ?</li>
     <br> <li>In our limited physical world, if something is to be destroyed, then something must be created! But speaking as per grandfather paradox, If suppose you made a time machine and went into ur past, and killed ur mom and dad before thier marriage, then you won't be created but you are destroyed !!</li>
     <br> <li>When a candle burns, the flame heats the nearby air and starts to rise. Basically, the continuous movement of hot air going up displaces cooler air down to the side which then gets heated up again and move upwards causing the distinctive shape of the flame and which is why it points only upwards.</li>   
     <br> <li> Can friction coefficient be greater than 1? Can friction coefficient be less than 0?</li>    
     <br> <li>Given five options choose any one:
        Which theory do you agree with?
        Matter at the smallest Level is made of matter ie quarks and all(massed material)
        Matter at the smallest level is not actually made of matter it is made of fields only(QFT)
        Matter at the smallest level is made of matter without mass(not actually matter but like massless particles
        Matter at the smallest level can never be found cause matter is indivisible(just we are making a bigger one into pieces ..then we can make anything into pieces so threr is no worth speaking smallest part of matter.
        Not interested in it cause matter does not matter me what matters me matter's matter i.e. feeling and emotions.</li>   
     <br> <li>Prove does not exist is not same as infinite with an example.</li>
     <br> <li>Comment: symmetry arguments play important role in simplifying the algebra involved in problems (in many situations we come across)</li>
     <br> <li>Entropy is the measure of unavailable energy to do useful work.Entropy never decreases as a whole.</li> 
     <br> <li>Thermodynamics in black hole :
        When 2 black holes merge, then the area of event horizon of new black hole will be not be less than area of event horizon of both parent black holes.</li>
      <br><li>Energy can never be created nor be destroyed.
        Entropy can be created but never destroyed.
        Mass can be created and can be destroyed (not broadly speaking, not considering mass as form of energy).
        Is there anything which cant be created but be destroyed? looks silly cause without creation how can something be destroyed (generally we all think) but physics(science /reality) is something which is beyond our scope and there's something which can't be created but can be destroyed.</li>
     <br> <li>The rotor-bearing system is the core component of the rotating equipment. Due to long-term operation of these rotating machinery and due to the influence of other multiple factors (e.g., environment, load demand fluctuation, operation and maintenance issues), the key-parts (i.e., bearing and rotor) of rotor–bearing system will inevitably suffer from damage. Once it fails, may cause the machines to stop working and thus reduce the
        productivity, or may cause accidents resulting in casualties. This risk of loss in productivity and accidents are even more with the growing need of increasing efficiencies of rotating machinery by further optimizing the rotor-stator gap. Therefore, it is of great practical significance to do condition monitoring of the rotor-bearing system, which will ensure the safe and stable operation of rotating machinery equipment.During the operation of these rotating machines, the vibration signals contain a large amount of information that characterizes its operating state. Therefore, the analysis of vibration signals has become a widely used method for intelligent condition monitoring. With the recent development in the field of intelligent and predictive maintenance of rotating machinery, usage of massive amount of data generated from the operating
        the status of the equipment has become a key thing.
   <br> <li>The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating the energy mainly as visible light and infrared radiation. It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometres (864,000 miles), or 109 times that of Earth. Its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, and accounts for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. Roughly three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V) based on its spectral class. As such, it is informally and not completely accurately referred to as a yellow dwarf (its light is closer to white than yellow). It formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud. Most of this matter gathered in the center, whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System. The central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its core. The enormous effect of the Sun on Earth has been recognized since prehistoric times. The Sun has been regarded by some cultures as a deity. The synodic rotation of Earth and its orbit around the Sun are the basis of solar calendars, one of which is the Gregorian calendar, the predominant calendar in use today.</li>  
      Our Solar System consists of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity — the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, dwarf planets such as Pluto, dozens of moons and millions of asteroids, comets and meteoroids. Originally applied to the Solar System, the process of planetary system formation is now thought to be at work throughout the universe. The widely accepted modern variant of the Nebular Theory is the Solar Nebular Disk Model (SNDM) or Solar Nebular Model. It offered explanations for a variety of properties of the Solar System, including the nearly circular and coplanar orbits of the planets, and their motion in the same direction as the Sun's rotation. Some elements of the original nebular theory are echoed in modern theories of planetary formation, but most elements have been superseded.
      Yes, photons can't escape black holes, but photons emitted by the material before falling onto the black hole can be detected with a tremendously challenging effort. Such efforts include the usage of three possible techniques:
        (1) We study the spectroscopic and time-dependent variability of photons emitted in different energies mostly in X-rays and Gamma rays. We use high-resolution CCD imaging, large-area gas detector and spectroscopic instruments onboard satellites
        (2) Gravitational-wave detector measurements
        (3) X-ray polarisation measurements (4) Direct imaging using long-wavelength interferometry.</li>
   <br>  <li> The northern celestial hemisphere, also called the Northern Sky, is the northern half of the celestial sphere; that is, it lies north of the celestial equator. The southern counterpart is the southern celestial hemisphere or the Southern sky. A constellation is an area on the celestial sphere in which a group of visible stars forms a perceived outline or pattern, typically representing an animal, mythological person or creature, or an inanimate object. A general list of 88 constellations was produced for the International Astronomical Union in 1922. It is roughly based on the traditional Greek constellations listed by Ptolemy in his Almagest in the 2nd century and Aratus' work Phenomena, with early modern modifications and additions.  
      star is an astronomical object consisting of a luminous spheroid of plasma held together by its own gravity.
        A star's life cycle is determined by its mass. The larger its mass, the shorter its life cycle. As the main sequence star glows, hydrogen in its core is converted into helium by nuclear fusion. The outer shell of the star, which is still mostly hydrogen, starts to expand. As it expands, it cools and glows red. The star then reaches the red giant phase. All stars evolve the same way up to the red giant phase. The amount of mass a star has determines which of the following life cycle paths it will take from there.
        The illustration above compares the different evolutionary paths low-mass stars (like our Sun) and high-mass stars take after the red giant phase. For low-mass stars (left hand side), after the helium has fused into carbon, the core collapses again. As the core collapses, the outer layers of the star are expelled. A planetary nebula is formed by the outer layers. The core remains as a white dwarf and eventually cools to become a black dwarf.
        On the right of the illustration is the life cycle of a massive star (10 times or more the size of our Sun). Like low-mass stars, high-mass stars are born in nebulae and evolve and live in the Main Sequence. A massive star will undergo a supernova explosion. If the remnant of the explosion is 1.4 to about 3 times as massive as our Sun, it will become a neutron star. The core of a massive star that has more than roughly 3 times the mass of our Sun after the explosion will do something quite different. The force of gravity overcomes the nuclear forces which keep protons and neutrons from combining. The core is thus swallowed by its own gravity. It has now become a black hole which readily attracts any matter and energy that comes near it.  
      Nebula is a giant cloud of dust and gas in space. Some nebulae (more than one nebula) come from the gas and dust thrown out by the explosion of a dying star, such as a supernova. Other nebulae are regions where new stars are beginning to form. For this reason, some nebulae are called "star nurseries."Nebulae are made of dust and gases—mostly hydrogen and helium. The dust and gases in a nebula are very spread out, but gravity can slowly begin to pull together clumps of dust and gas. As these clumps get bigger and bigger, their gravity gets stronger and stronger. Eventually, the clump of dust and gas gets so big that it collapses from its own gravity. The collapse causes the material at the centre of the cloud to heat up-and this hot core is the beginning of a star.  
     Galaxies are vast cosmic islands of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter held together by gravity. Hubble's keen eye has revealed intricate details of the shapes, structures, and histories of galaxies — whether alone, as part of small groups, or within immense clusters. Astronomers classify galaxies into three major categories: elliptical, spiral and irregular. These galaxies span a wide range of sizes, from dwarf galaxies containing as few as 100 million stars to giant galaxies with more than a trillion stars.The Big Bang Theory is the leading explanation about how the universe began. At its simplest, it says the universe as we know it started with a small singularity, then inflated over the next 13.8 billion years to the cosmos that we know today. Crucially, the theory is compatible with Hubble-Lemaître law – the observation that the farther away galaxies are, the faster they are moving away from Earth. Extrapolating this cosmic expansion backwards in time using the known laws of physics, the theory describes a high density state preceded by a singularity in which space and time lose meaning. There is no evidence of any phenomena prior to the singularity. Detailed measurements of the expansion rate of the universe place the Big Bang at around 13.8 billion years ago, which is thus considered the age of the universe.According to the idea, called bouncing cosmology, the universe was born not just once, but possibly multiple times in endless cycles of contraction and expansion. Initially, the universe was permeated only by energy. Some of this energy congealed into particles, which assembled into light atoms like hydrogen and helium. These atoms clumped first into galaxies, then stars, inside whose fiery furnaces all the other elements were forged. From its expansion and acceleration to dark matter and energy, the universe continues to amaze and perplex astronomers.  
      The Higgs boson reached overnight fame in 2012 when it was finally discovered in a jumble of other particles generated at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Geneva, Switzerland. The discovery was monumental because the Higgs boson, which had only been theorized about previously, has the special property of endowing other elementary particles with mass. It is also exceedingly rare and difficult to identify in the debris of colliding particles.
        This summer, for the first time, particle physicists using data collected by the experiment known as the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) at the LHC, have found evidence that the Higgs boson decays into a pair of elementary particles called muons. The muon is a heavier version of the electron, and both muons and electrons belong to a class of particles known as fermions, as described in the widely accepted model of particles called the Standard Model. The Standard Model classifies all particles as either fermions or bosons. Generally, fermions are building blocks of all matter, and bosons are the force carriers.
        A muon is also what is known as a second-generation particle. First-generation fermion particles such as electrons are the lightest of particles; second- and third-generation particles can decay to become first-generation particles. The new finding represents the first evidence that the Higgs boson interacts with second-generation fermions.        “The importance of this measurement is that we are probing rare processes involving the Higgs boson, and we are in the precision Higgs physics investigation regime where any departure from the Standard Model predictions can point us to new physics,” says Maria Spiropulu, the Shang-Yi Ch'en Professor of Physics at Caltech.Researchers using SOFIA have made the ﬁrst-ever detection of the water molecule (H2O) on the sunlit surface of the Moon. This discovery reﬁnes our understanding of the behavior of water and how volatile elements and compounds interact with airless bodies throughout the Solar System and beyond.</li>    
   <br> <li>Water and other volatiles can inﬂuence the internal processes and surface expression of planets. Water suppresses the melting point of rock, promoting volcanism, and reduces the viscosity of planetary interiors, enabling more efﬁcient internal circulation and heat transfer. Water and other volatiles tend to concentrate on planetary surfaces, creating atmospheres, hydrospheres, and cryospheres, and can even dominate the surface geology.Water has been detected previously in trace amounts in the lunar exosphere and in sparse occurrences as ice in permanent shadow at the lunar poles, but the possible pathways of water through the lunar environment are poorly understood. For decades, laboratory studies have shown that water's cousin, hydroxyl (OH-), can form from the hydrogen in the solar wind and oxygen in lunar minerals. Lunar hydroxyl has been detected remotely in reﬂectance spectra at 3 µm by spacecraft.
         A Nebula is an interstellar cloud of dust, H, He and other ionized gases .The term was used to describe any diffuse astronomical object, including galaxies beyond the Milky Way.Planetary Nebula is a type of emission nebula consisting of an expanding ,glowing shell of ionised gas ejected from red gaint stars.It is likely to play a crucial role in the chemical evolution of the milky way by expelling elements into interstellar medium from stars where those elements were created.Helix Nebula is an example of planetary nebula .It is one of the closest to the earth of all the bright nebulae.It is located in the constellation Aquarius.<br>  
      When the core of a massive star undergoes gravitational collapse, it's protons and electrons get scrunched up together under such an high pressure, leaving behind a NEUTRON STAR. A teaspoon of this star would weigh upto Mount Everest!!
        Neutron stars dazzle strong gravity, powerful magnetic and electric fields and very high velocities.
        A Neutron star can have a catastrophic impact on anything that comes near it; involving great discomfort for a human body....Most known Neutron star is a PULSAR. It rapidly pulsates beam of radio waves in the form of narrow cones, which periodically sweep over Earth.
        Owing to this we have been able to capture the sounds that various Pulsars produce. The one depicted is of a radio pulsar in northern sky aged around 5.5 million years old!! 
      More than a century has passed since Einstein gave 'General Relativity', though there have been many tests of relativity, this was first involving a giant black hole- Sagittarius A*.
        This monster lurks at the core of Milky way galaxy some 26,000 light years from Earth!!</li>
    <br>  <li>The wavelength of light becomes longer when star draws close to black hole. This is known as "Gravitational Redshifting" as predicted in General theory of Relativity!!</li>
     <br>  <li>In theoretical physics, a kugelblitz is a concentration of heat, light or radiation so intense that its energy forms an event horizon and becomes self-trapped: according to general relativity and the equivalence of mass and energy, if enough radiation is aimed into a region, the concentration of energy can warp spacetime enough for the region to become a black hole, although this would be a black hole whose original mass-energy had been in the form of radiant energy rather than matter.</li>
