            <p>Physics is a vast subject containing numerous sub-branches and theories. It is more worthier to understand physics experimantally rather than mugging up the theory.Most importantly, to understand physics you need to look with an eye of physics. Here we give an oveview of the most intriguing and intersting topics in detail. Science is all about finding its mysteries. It includes from the biggest galaxies in depth of space to the smallest sub-atomic particles in an atom. Math is the heart of Physics. It is a language to describe the beauty of physics. "When you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change !", said someone. You really need to think in terms of physics to understand the symmetry and charm of physics. ou are always living in the past.
                Everything you are experiencing right now actually happened 80 milliseconds ago. Random errors are inevitable you cannot avoid them when you are able to avoid them completely then it means your brain is working perfect at instants don't worry. Everyone seems to have fixed ideas about the nature of time. Time isn't a single line, moving from past to future. Let's say I go back in time and kill someone we'll call "A". This alters something called the divergence number, and the world line moves to a world without "A". When there's a world line move, people's memories are altered. In other words, memories of the world line where A existed are deleted and replaced with memories of a world line where A doesn't exist.

                    <p>Here are few intersting questions to think on..</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Can heat capacity at constant pressure be less than heat capacity at constant volume ...disobeying Mayer's relation?</li>
                        <li>Can gravity repel? Is it possible to do so?</li>
                        <li>Can coefficient of friction be negative?</li>
                        <li>Is average temperature of universe really increasing as said in theories ?</li>
                        <li>Boson is called God particle.. then! really is a particle called boson providing mass to other particles like protons, electrons, photons?</li>
                        <li>Does work depend on frame of reference ?</li>
                        <li>Do aliens exist ?</li>
                        <li>Does nothingness have something?</li>
                        <li>Can refractive index (not relative refractive index**) of a material be less than one?</li>
                        <li>Can humans ever prove the existence of white holes in reality (other than theories)?Firstly, do they really exist ?</li>
                    </ul>
